# Wordle Backend
This project is a replication of the popular Wordle game. It was made to improve
my web development skills and further extend my toolset after completing the
[FullStackOpen course](https://github.com/IImpaq/fullstackopen).

## Developing
To work on the project, start a development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building
To create a production version of your app:
```bash
npm run build
```
